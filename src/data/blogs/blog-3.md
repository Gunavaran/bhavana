With the aging population in Sri Lanka growing, it becomes necessary to arrange specialized care and treatment to meet the needs of the elderly. The first step in this process is to identify such needs. This institution-based, descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in the medical clinics at the Teaching Hospital Jaffna, with the aim of assessing the prevalence and correlates of depression, cognitive impairment, and disability among the elderly patients attending these clinics. Depression was assessed by the 15-item Geriatric Depression scale, while cognitive status was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and disability by the 12-item interviewer-administered World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Sociodemographic details were collected by a short questionnaire.

The results of this study revealed that among the elders attending the clinic, 2 in 5 had depression, 4 in 5 had cognitive impairment, while almost all had some degree of disability. Furthermore, females and those living alone were found to be more at risk of developing depression. Those not in marital life were found more likely to develop depression, and disability, while those with no formal education or only primary education more likely to develop cognitive impairment, and disability.
