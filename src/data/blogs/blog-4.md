The COVID-19 pandemic had put a tremendous strain upon the healthcare system, creating many challenges for healthcare workers. These challenges include not only increased workload, and mental health outcomes, but also other broader concerns, such as concern for their families and fear of stigmatization. During the initial months of the pandemic, all the studies assessing the level of various mental health conditions among healthcare workers, were carried out abroad. As a result, none of them reflected the views of healthcare workers in Sri Lanka during that time.

With this in mind, this institution-based, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with the aim of exploring the concerns of healthcare workers, through their perceived level of satisfaction of knowledge, training, and sense of competence regarding this pandemic, satisfaction in arrangements made in working environments, feeling of compassion and commitment, and perception on selected challenges. This study also described the influence of selected demographic and job-related factors on these concerns.
Carried out at Teaching Hospital Jaffna, among healthcare workers, including medical and dental specialists, medical and dental doctors, nursing officers, and health service assistants, this study led to the conclusion that despite their concerns and difficulties, 84.2% of the health care workers felt happy providing their services during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus showing the spirit of the health care workers.
