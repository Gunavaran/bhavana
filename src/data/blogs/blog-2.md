The Mental Health Unit at Teaching Hospital Jaffna is perhaps the largest mental health facility in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. It handles a huge caseload, and provides all kinds of services from assessments, medical and psychological managements, electroconvulsive therapies, liaison services, and forensic assessments. In addition, it also serves as the hub for the rest of the district mental health services. It serves around 2000 new patients a year, among which, around 1000 are from ward referrals. Since there has always been a high demand for mental health services and a lack of adequate staff members, the unit hardly has any detailed descriptions of the services it provides. In this background, this audit on the consultation-liaison services is designed to shed light on the service demands and deliveries.

This institution-based descriptive cross-sectional study, which is being conducted in the Mental Health Unit of Teaching Hospital Jaffna, aims to describe the sociodemographic and clinical profile of the patients referred to the Mental Health Unit of Teaching Hospital Jaffna.

This study is currently in its data collection phase. Two interim reports have been presented at scientific conferences.

Involved in drafting the study protocol and designing the data collection tool. Carried out the interim data analysis using RStudio. Contributed to the presentation at the Research Conference of Faculty of Medicine, Jaffna - 2022, and designed the poster presented at the Annual Academic Sessions 2022 of the Sri Lanka College of Psychiatrists.
