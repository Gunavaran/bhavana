A significant number of people with mental illnesses and related disabilities are often at risk of long-term institutionalization and/or homelessness due to the conspicuous absence of pathways for reintegration into the society. The situation remains the same in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, where a significant number of homeless mentally ill persons are staying in institutions other than hospitals.

In this context, the Home Again: Housing with Supportive Services for People with Psychosocial Disabilities Experiencing Long-Term Care Needs program, which is an initiation of the Banyan organization, a non-governmental organization based in Chennai, India, and funded by Grand Challenges Canada using funds received from the Department of Health and Social Care, through the National Institute for Health Research, United Kingdom, gives an opportunity to reintegrate 40 mentally ill clients in Northern Sri Lanka, who have long been living in institutionalized settings, into the community by providing supportive housing facilities and enhancing their independent living skills.

This study proposes to explore the effectiveness of such a program by studying its outcome. It aims to determine the psychosocial outcome of a supported housing program for the mentally ill at the end of 06 months and 12 months.

Designed as a longitudinal descriptive study that is being carried out among 40 participants of the ‘Home Again’ project, in the supported houses set up in community settings, this study employs quantitative approach in a repeated measures design, to determine the changes in participants over time. The outcomes of interest at the participant level are measured using the Modified Colorado Symptom Index scale, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, Quality of Life Interview (TL 30s), Community Integration Questionnaire, and Herth Hope Index. This study is currently in its data collection phase.
