The incidence, prevalence, and awareness of neuro-developmental disorders, particularly Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are on the increase in Sri Lanka, on par with the rest of the world. However, the services related to neuro-developmental disorders are only slowly being developed in this country. Providing care for children with ASD is carried out using various models of interventions. However, these interventions consume a lot of resources and facilities. Since Autism is a spectrum of disorders, each child diagnosed with ASD needs an individualized set of interventions.

In spite of the resource-limited setting, a center for neuro-developmental disorders was developed in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in 2014, with the partnership of the Department of Health, Mental Health Society, and the International Medical Health Organization. For over seven years, this institution has been providing various services, including assessing children for Autism Spectrum Disorder, providing initial training for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, speech therapy services, and much more. In this context, this study describes the clinical and sociodemographic profile of the children who have attended Mathavam with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

The male:female ratio of the children was found to be 5:2. The mean ages of suspicion, diagnosis and seeking help from the center were found to be 2.7, 3.4, and 3.7 years respectively. During the initial assessment, the mean CARS score of these children was 31.9 (SD 4.2). The major clinical presentations were recorded as speech related complaints (100%), poor eye contact (95%), not responding to call (95%), poor socialization (96.7%), and stereotypic behaviors (81%). The major sensory issues were found to be in the vestibular (66%), touch (56%), visual (53%) and auditory (31%) domains.

Involved in all phases of the study. Contributed to drafting the protocols, designing the data extraction forms, data cleaning, management of the database, and analyzing the data. Presented this study at the 5th Biennial Conference of the Sri Lanka Association for Child Development.
